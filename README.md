# 🏥 Hospital Database Management System

## 📄 Project Description
This project is a complete **Hospital Database Management System** built using **MySQL**. It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of hospital-related data such as patients, doctors, appointments, rooms, and billing. The system enforces data integrity using foreign keys and constraints, and models real-world relationships such as 1:1, 1:M, and M:M.
